# BrailleOrder
Among the more frustrating tasks of the novice braille transcriber for every transcription is sorting the Special Symbols Page into braille order. It is a tedious task which is done by hand using a reference chart:

This web application will allow a braillist to paste their list of special symbols (groups of ASCII characters) and rearrange the list into braille order at the click of a button. 

# Other Features
- Alert for a symbol includes a character that is not ASCII Braille 
- Alert when a symbol is not required to be included in the Special Symbols Page.
- Alert that a symbol is not in the Known Symbols database (see http://www.iceb.org/symbsc2.html).
  - a way to request the alerted symbol be added to the "known symbols" database.
