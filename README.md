# BrailleOrder
Among the more frustrating tasks of the novice braille transcriber 
is sorting the Special Symbols Page into braille order 
which is done by hand using this reference chart (see http://brailleauthority.org/ueb/symbols_list.pdf). 

This web application will allow a braillist to paste their special symbols (groups of ASCII characters) 
and rearrange the list into braille order at the click of a button.
